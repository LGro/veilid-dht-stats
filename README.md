# Veilid DHT Lifetime Experiments

The main scripts creates records in the Veilid Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and can be
used to periodically check if they are (still) available on the network.
The results are written to a JSON file for analysis and visualization purposes.

Check out the Veilid Python setup instructions
[here](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/tree/main/veilid-python?ref_type=heads#veilid-bindings-for-python).

And for analyses, start with the scripts and additional requirements in `analysis/`.
